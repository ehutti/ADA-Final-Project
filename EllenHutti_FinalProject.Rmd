library(dplyr)
library(haven)
library(table1)

## Load data
```{r}
NISTEEN <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ehutti/ADA-Final-Project/main/NISTEEN18.csv")
```

## Check HPV vaccine variable
```{r}
# Check variable class
class(NISTEEN$HPV_binary)
table(NISTEEN$HPV_binary)

# Make outcome variable
NISTEEN <- NISTEEN %>% 
  mutate(HPV_binary = 
           case_when(HPVI_ANY %in% c("No") ~ 0, 
                     HPVI_ANY %in% c("Yes") ~ 1),
         HPV_binary = factor(HPV_binary, 0:1, c("No", "Yes")))
```

## Create table 1
```{r}
# Add labels to the variables

label(NISTEEN$CEN_REG)<-"Geographic region"
label(NISTEEN$EDUC1)<-"Mother's education attainment"
label(NISTEEN$RACEETHK)<-"Race or ethnicity"
label(NISTEEN$SEX)<-"Sex"
label(NISTEEN$FACILITY)<-"Type of healthcare facility"
label(NISTEEN$INS_STAT2_I)<-"Type of insurance"
label(NISTEEN$INCQ298A)<-"Income"

# Create table 1
table1(~AGE + SEX + RACEETHK + INCQ298A + INS_STAT2_I + EDUC1 | HPVI_ANY, NISTEEN)

## Construct complex survey design

## Plot Cookâ€™s Distance to assess influential observations
``` {r}
# Plot of Cook's distance to identify top 5 influential observations for adjusted education model
plot(adjeducglm, which=4, id.n=5, col="red") 

# Plot of Cook's distance to identify top 5 influential observations for adjusted insurance model
plot(adjinsurglm, which=4, id.n=5, col="red") 

# No concerning Cook's distances found for either model

## Test model significance
# Education attainment model
```{r}
# Use Wald test to assess significance of mother's education attainment
wald.test(b = coef(adjmineducglm), Sigma = vcov(adjmineducglm), Terms = 2:4)

# Results of Wald test (X2=33.6, p<0.01) suggest that the overall model effects of mother's education attainment are statistically significant.

# Insurance status model
```{r}
# Use Wald test to assess significance of mother's education attainment
wald.test(b = coef(adjinsurglm), Sigma = vcov(adjinsurglm), Terms = 2:4)

# Results of Wald test (X2=8.2, p<0.05) suggest that the overall model effects of insurance status are statistically significant.
